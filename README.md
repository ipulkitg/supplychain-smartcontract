# üîê Smart Contract for Asset Management on a Distributed Ledger (Go)

## üìò Overview

This project demonstrates a basic **smart contract implementation in Go**, designed to interact with a decentralized ledger. It is a simplified simulation that introduces core smart contract principles such as **asset creation**, **ownership transfer**, and **state querying**. The focus is to showcase how **Go** can be used for writing smart contracts that could be integrated with blockchain systems like **Hyperledger Fabric**.

## üß† Key Features

- üîê **Create Asset** ‚Äì Add new assets with a unique ID and owner
- üîÑ **Transfer Asset** ‚Äì Change the ownership of an existing asset
- üì• **Query Asset** ‚Äì Retrieve asset details from the ledger
- ‚ùå **Delete Asset** ‚Äì (Optional) Remove an asset for test/demo purposes
- üßæ **State Ledger** ‚Äì Mimics persistent storage of asset state using a key-value structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Execution**: Local simulation or integration-ready for Hyperledger Fabric chaincode
- **Storage Abstraction**: In-memory or blockchain ledger store
- **Function Routing**: Entry-point handler dispatches calls to internal functions

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. A client sends a transaction request to the smart contract
2. The contract checks the function name and routes it internally
3. Depending on the call, it will:
   - Create and store a new asset
   - Update the owner of an asset
   - Retrieve data associated with an asset ID
4. All transactions assume a simple key-value storage format (`map[string]string` style)

## üìä Sample Functions (Defined in `smartcontract.go`)

```go
func CreateAsset(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, id string, owner string) error
func ReadAsset(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, id string) (string, error)
func TransferAsset(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, id string, newOwner string) error
func DeleteAsset(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, id string) error
```

Each function uses the `contractapi` interface to interact with the ledger, enabling plug-and-play usage within a real blockchain system like Hyperledger Fabric.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run (Local Test)

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartcontract-asset-go.git
   cd smartcontract-asset-go
   ```

2. **Build the contract (if used standalone):**
   ```bash
   go build smartcontract.go
   ```

3. **Run logic via Go test/driver file:**  
   Add a custom driver (`main.go`) to call the functions and simulate usage.

   Example usage inside `main.go`:
   ```go
   CreateAsset(ctx, "asset1", "Alice")
   TransferAsset(ctx, "asset1", "Bob")
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This contract currently does not include a main or test driver. You may create one to simulate function calls or embed this contract within a Hyperledger Fabric deployment.
